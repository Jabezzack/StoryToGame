            "Story: So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly . <newline> It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging . <newline> <newline> 5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence . <newline> <newline> Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was . <newline> <newline> If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can.. <newline> I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence . <newline> I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago . <newline> <newline> I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me . <newline> <newline> A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ... <newline> <newline> `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice . <newline> <newline> `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it . <newline> <newline> Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .\n",
